# Yongzhi Qi
- Technical Director of the Supply Chain Algorithm Team at **JD.com (JINGDONG)** 
- Guest Professor at the University of Hong Kong
- Committee member of the Data Science and Operations Intelligence Branch of the Operations Research Society of China

I obtained my Ph.D. from Shandong University in 2016, then did postdoctoral research at the China Electric Power Research Institute. During this time, I also spent some time as a visiting scholar at Stanford University, focusing on optimizing water supply systems. In 2018, I joined JD.com, where I’ve been working on supply chain optimization ever since.

My work spans various aspects of the supply chain, such as **assortment planning, pricing, inventory management, network planning, and fulfillment**. I lead some key projects funded by China’s National Ministry of Science and Technology, collaborating with businesses and research institutions to create an intelligent supply chain AI platform.

I’ve published in journals like *Management Science*, *Production and Operations Management Society (POMS)*, *Manufacturing & Service Operations Management (M&SOM)*, and *IEEE Transactions*. It is with great honor that I share my team and I have been recognized with several prestigious awards, including being finalists for the **INFORMS Franz Edelman Award** and winning awards like the **INFORMS Prize** and **Gartner’s Technology Innovation Award**.
